This code asks you to pick from a menu of options (1-6) all of which have different funtions.
Option 1 will list out the directory contents.
Option 2 will make a new folder and delete the old one.
Option 3 will create a new directory.
Option 4 will echo out the phrase "Hello World!" "Command executed succesfully."
Option 5 will concatenate 2 text files.

If you do not choose an option between 1 and 6 the UI will tell you that it is a invalid input.
